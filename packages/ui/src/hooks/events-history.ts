// These helpers run over events read back from on-disk history (`/api/events`),
// which may have been persisted under an older schema than the running build.
// They are deliberately field-tolerant: every field access falls back rather than
// asserts, so a schema change never crashes a history reload. The invariant that
// `data` is a non-null object is enforced upstream in core's FileStore reader
// (`isNextDogEvent`), so unknown/old shapes are dropped before they reach here.
// We keep these dependency-free on purpose — `@nextdog/ui` is the lowest package
// in the dependency graph (core depends on ui, not the reverse), so it cannot
// borrow core's `NextDogEvent` type without a cycle, and a published SDK UI should
// not pull a parser/serializer library (zod/lodash) into every consumer's bundle.

/**
 * Stable de-duplication key for an event. Spans are keyed by their unique spanId.
 * Logs have no unique id, so they are keyed by service + timestamp + message, which
 * is stable across history reloads and live SSE delivery of the same record.
 *
 * Schema-change behavior: missing optional fields fall back (`?? ''` / envelope
 * timestamp), and a span without a spanId degrades to a log-style key rather than
 * throwing. Worst case a renamed field yields a different key and an event is shown
 * twice — never a crash.

 * Without a cap, the client buffer grew with every SSE message for the lifetime of
 * the session, and because each message re-ran an O(n) dedup + O(n log n) re-sort
 * of the *entire* buffer (see {@link mergeEvents}), per-event cost climbed with the
 * buffer size — O(n²) over a session. Under real traffic the main thread saturated
 * and the page froze (felt acutely while scrolling). Small-dataset QA never hit it.

 * out-of-order delivery is binary-inserted. Cost per call is therefore bounded by
 * `cap`, not by how long the session has been running (issue #58).
