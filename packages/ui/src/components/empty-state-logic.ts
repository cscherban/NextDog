/**
 * Pure state-selection for the first-run / empty experience.
 *
 * The dashboard surfaces three distinct "nothing to show" situations, each of
 * which needs different copy (issue #11):
 *
 *  - `disconnected`    — the sidecar is unreachable (setup not done / port
 *                        conflict). Show the setup checklist.
 *  - `connected-idle`  — connected, but we have never received an event. Nudge
 *                        the dev to generate their first trace.
 *  - `filter-empty`    — events exist, but the current filter hides all of them.
 *                        (Rendered inline by the list views, not the overlay.)
 *  - `populated`       — events are visible; no empty state.
 *
 * Inputs are all derived from existing client state — no extra network calls:
 *  - `connected`     — the SSE connection signal (use-sse).
 *  - `everReceived`  — have we *ever* seen an event this session (latched true
 *                      once any event arrives; survives a manual Clear).
 *  - `filterActive`  — is a search query or service filter currently applied.
